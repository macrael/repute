Not much going on yet. Idea is to keep track of who you are reading online.

Setup
-----

1. sudo easy_install django
2. sudo easy_sintall django_evolution
3. cp settings.py.template settings.py
4. look for instances of /PATH/TO/PROJECT/ in settings.py and fix them
5. set your timezone in settings.py
6. look for instances of localhost:8000 and point them somewhere else if you like
7. python manage.py syncdb
8. python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 (or whatever you set as the server?)

To run in the background: nohup python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8005 &

If you are running on a bare bones linux server, you will need to make sure that everything is set up to support utf-8 printing to the console (right now lots of debugging output might include utf-8)
