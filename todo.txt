New Django Project:
Notes. Just a bookmarklet that lets me append notes to a file. This lets me
send back notes on this project as I am using it. The best way to get feedback
into the app.

VIEWS
* recent list
    * Will need proper ajax deletion

* Author list
    * /authors
    * go recently read or a[habetical or quantity read

BOOKMARKLET
* make sure the css is overriding everything. It is looking weird on some sites

x align all text/fields properly

* allow the user to move it
    * remeber where it was moved to?

x have initial add be done in the actual bookmarklet
    * this way we can one day customize the response for different sites

x make it attached to the viewport, float. don't be attached to the top of the
  body. I am usually scrolled down when i click read.
    * This needs to work on iphone/ipad

* needs ui
    * some indication that it is doing sometihng
    * drop down like a sheet from the top of the screen
        * swoosh in from above, then away. 

get author name
    * have a field you can type into, or just hilight the name
        *someday, could have you click, figure out the element and train the
            parser for that site?

get notes about article (/author?)

x get votes


USERS
* signup
* custom submit javascript
* session modifies what is displayed


SITE PARSING
* this is going to have to be some sort of configurable dealie per site
    * a regex that gets the title out of the titlebar?
        * how does instapaper do this? (it does not...)
        * might not be worth it, plus the title gives you some information
    
    * Getting the author name. 
        * for lots of sites, it is just one author per site
        * for some sites, the author should be in a standard place 
            (if we get wordpress + tumblr should be most of the way there)
        * for some sites it is a custom jobbie. 
            * track if we are starting to get jibberish back.


ADD PATH
* need to be careful in getting back authors, what about people who share a
    name?
    * am I handling authors who are created correctly?

* probably drop the publised date
    * maybe track the orignally submitted date. 

x match incoming url to your urls. (URL/USER is a primary key) 
    * make this match fuzzy. If you can, strip off end detritus
        * might need rules for different sites on how to handle this

INFO BOOKMARKLET
* need to dispaly other artices you read by this person


RATING SYSTEM
* try a 4 star rating approach


FRONTPAGE
x put the bookmarklet up for me

----------

EVENTUALLY
* deploy on prgmr.
    * one day, deploy propperly on prgmr. (mod wsgi)
* get the correct script mime type for scripts
