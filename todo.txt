x basic bookmarklet
* bookmarklet 2.0





BOOKMARKLET
* have initial add be done in the actual bookmarklet
    * this way we can one day customize the response for different sites

* needs ui
    * some indication that it is doing sometihng
    * drop down like a sheet from the top of the screen

get author name
    * have a field you can type into, or just hilight the name
        *someday, could have you click, figure out the element and train the
            parser for that site?

get notes about article (/author?)

get votes



SITE PARSING
* this is going to have to be some sort of configurable dealie per site
    * a regex that gets the title out of the titlebar?
        * how does instapaper do this? (it does not...)
        * might not be worth it, plus the title gives you some information
    
    * Getting the author name. 
        * for lots of sites, it is just one author per site
        * for some sites, the author should be in a standard place 
            (if we get wordpress + tumblr should be most of the way there)
        * for some sites it is a custom jobbie. 
            * track if we are starting to get jibberish back.


ADD PATH
* need to be careful in getting back authors, what about people who share a
    name?

* probably drop the publised date

* match incoming url to your urls. (URL/USER is a primary key) 
    * make this match fuzzy. If you can, strip off end detritus
        * might need rules for different sites on how to handle this

INFO BOOKMARKLET
* need to dispaly other artices you read by this person
